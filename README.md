# CastleFarmer (In development)
A game about game balancing

There are two bases located at both ends of the map, both bases automatically spawn combat units and the units attacks the enemies automatically.
Player needs to control nothing but a variety of variables that would affect how the game developes.
For example, a player will be able to change: 
    1. The unit spawn interval of each base
    2. Unit health
    3. Unit movement speed
    4. Projectile damage
    5. Rate of fire of weapon
    etc.

The goal is to either achieve a certain degree of balance (keep both bases alive for n seconds) or the opposite (eliminate one of the bases in n seconds)
The flag capture system is introduced so that another goal could be to achieve a flag score of a:b within n seconds.
